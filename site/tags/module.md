# @module

**Tag Kind:** [Block](../tags.md#block-tags)

The `@module` tag is used to mark a comment as referring to a file rather than the declaration following it.
It may optionally be used to rename a module whose name TypeDoc guesses incorrectly.

The TSDoc specified [`@packageDocumentation`](packageDocumentation.md) tag can also be used to mark
a comment as referring to the file, but cannot be used to rename the module.

> [!note]
> A comment block where the `@module` tag is used must be the first comment in the file.
> Therefore, it is recommended to place it at the top of the file before any import statements.

## Example

```ts
// file1.ts
/**
 * This is the doc comment for file1.ts
 *
 * Specify this is a module comment and rename it to my-module:
 * @module my-module
 */
import * as lib from "lib";

// file2.ts
/**
 * Specify this is a module comment without renaming it:
 * @module
 */
import * as lib from "lib";

// file3.ts
/**
 * This is *not* a doc comment for the file, it is a doc comment for the import.
 * Include the `@module` or `@packageDocumentation` tag to mark it as a file comment.
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
```
