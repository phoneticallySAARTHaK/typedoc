# @packageDocumentation

**Tag Kind:** [Modifier](../tags.md#modifier-tags) <br>
**TSDoc Reference:** [@packageDocumentation](https://tsdoc.org/pages/tags/packageDocumentation/)

The `@packageDocumentation` tag is used to mark a comment as referring to a file rather than the declaration following it.
The TypeDoc specific [`@module`](module.md) tag can be used for the same purpose when semantically clearer.

> [!note]
> A comment block where the `@packageDocumentation` tag is used must be the first comment in the file.
> Therefore, it is recommended to place it at the top of the file before any import statements.

## Example

```ts
// file1.ts
/**
 * This is the doc comment for file1.ts
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
 */
import * as lib from "lib";

// file2.ts
/**
 * This is *not* a doc comment for the file, it is a doc comment for the import.
 * Include the `@module` or `@packageDocumentation` tag to mark it as a file comment.
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
```
